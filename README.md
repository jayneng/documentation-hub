## Purpose of the Project

This project is a web-based documentation hub built using **HTML** and **CSS**. It is designed to demonstrate how to document technical processes related to IT systems, game development, or software setups in a professional, organized, and accessible manner. The documentation hub provides easy-to-navigate sections and tutorials, complete with collapsible elements and internal linking, making it a user-friendly resource for technical teams.

## Structure of the Documentation

The documentation hub is organized as follows:

- **Index Page (`index.html`)**: The main landing page that provides an overview of the documentation topics.
- **CSS (`styles.css`)**: Provides styling for the documentation, ensuring readability, consistency, and responsive design.
- **Docs Folder (`/docs`)**: Contains the main HTML and CSS files for the documentation hub.

### Key Features

- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the documentation is viewable across devices.
- **Collapsible Sections**: Allows users to expand and collapse long sections of documentation for readability.
- **Internal Linking**: Links different sections of the documentation together for easy navigation.
- **Multi-Language Support (Planned)**: Future versions may include multi-language options.
- **Version Control**: Managed using GitHub, ensuring clear tracking of documentation updates.
